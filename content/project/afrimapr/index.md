afrimapr started in 2020 and was originally funded through the Wellcome Open Research Fund and Wellcome Data for Science and Health.

afrimapr creates R building blocks and learning resources to make it easier to make data-driven maps in Africa. The created resources are promoted in Africa and beyond to grow a community of users and developers to maintain and improve them.

afrimapr also develops tutorials and runs online workshops. 

In 2022 Talarify Foundation started supporting the afrimapr community by taking over the hosting of monthly community events, and maintaining the website and social media presence.
